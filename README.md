# AABB 2023 Presentation Deep Ensemble Learning
 ## Full Title
 Deep Ensemble Learning for Automated Red Blood Cell Morphology Classification  
 
 ## Description
 This repository contains slides presenting research on using deep ensemble learning for automated classification of red blood cell (RBC) morphology changes during storage. The slides were presented at the AABB 2023 Annual Meeting, and the research was conducted by biomedical engineers at the University of Houston.
 
 These slides describes the development of an open-source machine learning pipeline for segmenting, classifying, and tracking RBCs from microscopy images. The aim was to enable accurate and reproducible quantification of RBC morphological heterogeneity, which is currently done through time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis.
