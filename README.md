# AABB 2023 Presentation Deep Ensemble Learning
 Title: Deep Ensemble Learning for Automated Red Blood Cell Morphology Classification  Description:  This repository contains slides presenting research on using deep ensemble learning for automated classification of red blood cell (RBC) morphology changes during storage. The slides were presented at the AABB 2023 Annual Meeting.  The research was conducted by scientists at the University of Houston and describes the development of BloodML, an open-source machine learning pipeline for segmenting, classifying, and tracking RBCs from microscopy images. BloodML aims to enable accurate and reproducible quantification of RBC morphological heterogeneity, which is currently done through time-consuming and error-prone manual analysis.  The slides overview:  Background on the need for automated RBC analysis Details on the BloodML pipeline, including the image analysis, deep learning ensemble model, tracking algorithms, and dataset-specific analyses Performance metrics demonstrating 97-98% classification accuracy on manually-labeled datasets Sample visualizations and insights enabled through the automated analysis Summary of key accomplishments and potential limitations/future work Two main BloodML prototypes are presented:  Cells-In-Wells: tracks individual RBC morphology changes over time Morphology Heterogeneity: static analysis of morphological variation without tracking By releasing open-source code and data, this work aims to provide the RBC research community with an accurate, reproducible tool to propel studies on how storage affects RBC health and functionality.  The slides were presented at the AABB 2023 Annual Meeting as part of ongoing dissemination efforts to make researchers aware of BloodML's capabilities. Feedback from the presentation will inform continued open-source development and validation of this pipeline.
